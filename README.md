This tool lets you dump MS Access/MS Jet database schema as an SQL file containing the commands needed to recreate the database from the scratch.

It also lets you execute those files, or any other SQL files, or SQL commands from keyboard.

Usage information is available by doing "`jet help`". See complete help at project wiki.
