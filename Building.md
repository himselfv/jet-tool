Some notes about building the project from the sources

To build the Jet tool, you'll need to import DAO_TLB. To do that, open Component> Import Component, choose "Type Library" and select "Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library".

You might also need ADOX_TLB, for this import "Microsoft ADO Ext. 2.8 for DDL and Security".
